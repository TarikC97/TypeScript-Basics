Web browsers do not understand TypeScript natively.

Have to convert TypeScript code to JavaScript code.

This is known as Transpiling(Translating/Compiling).

Transpiling is accomplished with the tsc command.
After every change in code we need to transpile tsc file.
Only edit TypeScript files.

In terminal: tsc mydemo.ts(Converting tsc to js file).
Running file: node mydemo.js.

By default tsc will still generate a .js file even with problems.
To prevent that: tsc --noEmitOnError Customer.ts


Strongly typed:
	let found: boolean = true
	//Not allowed - found = 0;(type missmatch).
	Type:any - Allows every type.
	let found: any = 50, found = "Radi";
